    <h3>Redesigning the Museum Experience</h3>
    <h5 style="font-weight : lighter; padding-bottom : 50px">Making the Burke Museum more accessible.</h5>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>The Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture is a place of history, inspiration, and knowledge. It promotes diversity,
      inclusion, and equity, by preserving history of marginalized communities within our society.
      Although the museum was newly built in 2019, there were accessibility concerns that weren’t addressed properly.
      As part of an upper-level HCDE undergraduate coursework, we undertook the mission of designing a better experience for
      disabled museumgoers whose accessibility needs weren’t met. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Team: 4 Students</li>
        <li>Timeline: 2.5 Months</li>
        <li>Tools: Figma, Paper and Cardboard Prototype</li>
      </ul>
​     <h4 style="text-align : center">How might we design a safe,<br> inviting museum experience?</h4>
    <h4>Interviews</h4>
      <p style="font-weight : bold">Guiding Questions:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle ! important;">
        <li style="list-style-type: circle ! important; margin-left : 20px;">What were your expectations prior to the visit?</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: circle ! important; margin-left : 20px;">What was the museum environment like for you?</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: circle ! important; margin-left : 20px;">What part of the museum was most enjoyable to navigate?</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: circle ! important; margin-left : 20px;">What was most difficult?n</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-weight : bold">Insights:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle ! important;">
        <li style="list-style-type: circle ! important; margin-left : 20px;">Lack of rest areas and quiet spaces.</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: circle ! important; margin-left : 20px;">Difficult to navigate.</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: circle ! important; margin-left : 20px;">Human interaction is difficult for some users.</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: circle ! important; margin-left : 20px;">Easily gets crowded and noisy.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 style="padding-top : 50px">Personas</h4>
      <p>Based on our research, we developed the following personas...</p>
      <div class="row">
      <div class="col s6">
          <img src="../images/persona-1.png" width = "500px" height = "auto">
      </div>
      <div class="col s6">
        <img src="../images/persona-2.png" width = "500px" height = "auto">
    </div>
    </div>

    <h4 style="padding-top : 50px">Journey Map</h4>
    <p>We created a journey map based on Anna’s persona,
      which helps us review our ideas to find more possibilities
      in improving the user experience with our design.</p>
    <img src="../images/journey-map.png" width = "1100px" height = "auto" class="center">

    <h4 style="padding-top : 50px">Storyboard</h4>
    <img src="../images/storyboard.png" width = "1100px" height = "auto" class="center">

    <h4 style="padding-top : 50px">Information Architecture</h4>
    <p>To design the experience illustrated in our storyboard, we developed an
      information architecture plan to plan out the process in our museum redesign experience.</p>
    <img src="../images/infoarch.png" width = "800px" height = "auto" style="text-align : center">

    <h4 style="padding-top : 50px">Paper Prototype</h4>
    <p>Below are some low and high fidelity prototypes representing the physical
      experience of viewing accessibility information at the museum.</p>
      <div class="row">
    <img src="../images/physical-1.png" width = "800px" height = "auto">
    <img src="../images/physical-2.png" width = "800px" height = "auto">
    </div>

    <h4 style="padding-top : 50px">Hi-Fi Prototype</h4>
    <img src="../images/hifi-3.png" width = "800px" height = "auto" style="text-align : center">
    <p style="font-weight : bold">Key Design Changes:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle ! important;">
      <li style="list-style-type: circle ! important; margin-left : 20px;">Updated information hierarchy to include “Floor Guide” as last feature to improve information access.</li>
      <li style="list-style-type: circle ! important; margin-left : 20px;">Expanded clickability by prototyping both check boxes and text.</li>
      <li style="list-style-type: circle ! important; margin-left : 20px;">Included headings for each respective accessibility page to provide context.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="padding-top : 50px">Reflection</h4>
    <p>Through our project, we learned the design process and we also developed some key
      insights on collaboration and communication. Through user interviews
      and secondary research, we realized that there was a greater need for accessibility
      features to be communicated to those who had sensory sensitivities.</p>


    <p>There were some points in our process where we had to rethink whether some
    design features were necessary and feasible. If we had more time, we would probably
    go back and add a feature that allows users through sort through all the exhibits to only
    see non-busy exhibits. Also, because of time constraints, we were unable to do user testing
    with the users who had accessibility needs, which affected the end result of our product.</p>


    <p>Overall, we learned how to prioritize user needs and balance those with time
    and technical constraints. We couldn’t tackle every problem, but communicated
    and collaborated through design decisions to make the most feasible, usable product we could.</p>
