    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
    This project was part of an HCDE course in prototyping methods. In this project, we used several prototyping
    techniques to evaluate the usability, feasibility, and desirability of our service design idea -- Pocket Produce.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px" >Team: 4 Students</li>
      <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Timeline: 2 Weeks</li>
      <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Tools: Figma, Paper Prototype, Sewing, Laser Cutting, Video Prototype</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Concept</h4>
    <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
    The concept for our prototype was to create a way for users to easily identify if the food
    they are purchasing is local and in-season. Our product is an service where users can use an app to
    scan produce and see if it is in-season and/or local. Then, they can scan their receipt after they finish
    shopping in order to earn points based on purchasing local and/or in-season that allows them to recieve
    rewards. The rewards include fun pins that can be placed on the reusable bag we send them when signing
    up for the service!
    </p>
    <h4>Prototype Goals</h4>
    <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
    We have five prototype artifacts lsited below. Each one has a specific goal to help us gain insight into our design and make future improvements
    on subsequent prototypes.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
      <span style="font-weight : bold">Paper:</span> We chose this technique to create a low fidelity prototype of the app in order
       to understand what the flow and features of the app would look like. We were evaluating:
    </p>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Usability: Does the flow make sense and is easy to use?</li>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Desirability: Even at a simple glance, do users see themselves using a service like this?</li>
    <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
<span style="font-weight : bold">Figma:</span> We chose this technique in order to create a higher fidelity prototype of the app.
We based the design of this prototype on the feedback we received from the paper prototype. We were evaluating:

    </p>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Feasibility: Are all of the features we want to implement feasible in a mobile app?</li>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Feasibility: Can the options we present to the user be communicated effectively with the app?</li>
    <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
      <span style="font-weight : bold">Laser Cutting/Pins:</span>This prototype is a low fidelity way to get the look and feel of our rewards pins.
       We were evaluating:
    </p>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Feasibility: Is the size of the pin appropriate for adding to the bag?</li>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Desirability: Are pins appropriate for motivating users to use the app?</li>
    <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
<span style="font-weight : bold">Sewing/Bag:</span> This prototype is a sewed bag that users would recieve when signing up for our service. We
were evaluating:
</p>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Feasibility: Can the bag carry a full supply of groceries? Can the lining be removable?</li>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Usability: Are users able to take off and put on the lining?</li>
    <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
    <span style="font-weight : bold">Product Video:</span> we chose this technique as we wanted a way for users to see how the whole system of
     receiving a bag, using the app while shopping, using the app after shopping, and receiving rewards(pins) would look like. We were evaluating:
    </p>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Desirability: Is the process appealing to users?</li>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Feasibility: Do users feel like this would work?</li>
    <h4>Implementation</h4>
    <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
      To implement our service, we used several prototyping techniques: paper, Figma, soft-goods, laser-cutting, and video prototyping.
      All of these methods help to communicate our service to others while receiving feedback and critique. Based on critiques of our prototypes,
       we have a better understanding of the limitations of our service, and how it would be received in the real-world.
    </p>

    <h5>Paper Prototype</h5>
    <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
      The design of our app began with a paper prototype. The paper prototype serves as a way to quickly communicate features of the service,
      decide on the interaction flow, and visualize the hierarchy of information without spending a lot of time developing an actual app.
      While all prototypes are temporary tools to communicate ideas, the paper prototype was especially so, since after receiving feedback on it,
      we moved on to a more high-fidelity prototype.

    </div>
    <h5>Figma Prototype</h5>
    <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
    Up next, we created a figma prototype based on user testing on our paper prototype. the Figma prototype allowed us to explore visual design and
    evaluate aesthetics as we were able to use color and iconography. <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/59uphJkA55YQZDGOtRpRyQ/HCDE-451-Final-Prototype?node-id=5-4&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=5%3A4">Here</a> is a link to the Figma.

  </div>
    <h5>Soft Goods Prototype</h5>
    <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
    When looking to create the bag we decided that we wanted it to be reusable and offer something different then other reusable bags. We wanted
    it to be large enough to be able to carry all their groceries, have a removable lining in order to wash the inside when it got dirty,
    and a way to close the bag.

    </div>
    <h5>Laser Cut Prototype</h5>
    <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
      To get the look and feel of our rewards system, we laser cut pins.
    </p>
    <div class="row">

      </div>
    </div>
    <h5>Video Prototype</h5>
    <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
    Since our imagined service has so many different moving parts and elements, we decided to create a video prototype that explains Pocket
    Produce and the entire process of using the service. This prototype began with creating a storyboard and basic shot list,
    which are shown below.

  </div>
    <h4>Evaluation<h4>
    <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
    We conducted user interviews and usability testing in order to evaluate if our prototypes were successful and effective at addressing our
    design goals (listed above). Below are some questions we asked to evaluate our prototype with users:
    </p>
    <h5>Paper Prototype</h5>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Did you have any confusion while onboarding?</li>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Would you use a service like this? Why or why not?</li>
    <h5>Figma Prototype</h5>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">After scanning produce, are you able to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the food item?</li>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Is the visual system appealing to you?</li>
    <h5>Sewing Prototype</h5>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Can you remove the lining? How was the experience removing it?</li>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Do you think this could carry the average amount of groceries you purchase?</li>
    <h5>Laser Cut Prototype</h5>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Are the pins something you would want to collect as a part of the bag?</li>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">How do you think the pins will affect your shopping habits?</li>
    <h5>Video Prototype</h5>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Do you understand the process of using Pocket Produce?</li>
    <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Is this process something that would be convenient or a burden to use in grocery stores?</li>
    <h4>Analysis<h4>
    <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
    After completing our testing with users, we had plenty of feedback. Our rewards system could be more clear. Users were confused
    about how to gain points, and how those translated into pins. Additionally, users wanted stronger material for the bag.
    Some users mentioned some incorporation of pricing into the app so users who shop on a budget can also participate.
    This is just some of the valuable feedback we received. Future work would build off this work.
    Overall, this project showed the incredible value of prototypes as communication tools. Even with little time and resources, we were able
    to receive rich feedback from users.
