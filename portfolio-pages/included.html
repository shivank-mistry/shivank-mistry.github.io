        <h3>Happy to be Included </h3>
        <h5 style="font-weight : lighter; padding-bottom : 50px"> Improving DEI outcomes in the hiring process.</h5>


        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
          The need to hire <strong>diverse, qualified candidates</strong> is crucial for companies
           that are committed to improving Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) outcomes. Currently, recruiters face tensions
           between promoting diverse candidates while maintaining
          equal opportunity for all. This makes prioritizing diversity a challenge.<a href="https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/hcde-capstone-2023/all-projects/37-happy-to-be-included?authuser=0"> This
          project</a> hopes to design a solution for recruiters to hire qualified, diverse candidates
          while maintaing equal opportunity and avoiding adverse impact.
          We partnered with <a href="https://www.included.ai/">included.ai</a> for
          a 20 week long final capstone project in the department of human-centered design & engineering
          at the University of Washington.
        </p>
          <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px" >Team: 4 Students</li>
          <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Timeline: 20 weeks</li>
          <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Skills: Research, Ideation, Prototyping, SaaS Design</li>
          <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
        Our guiding design question throughout this project was:
        </p>

        <h4 style="text-align : center;padding-bottom : 50px">How might we improve the recruitment<br>
           process by matching hiring needs to
           <br>qualified, diverse candidates?</h4>
        <h4>Preliminary Research and Literature Review</h4>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
        Before looking towards a solution, our team needed a better understanding of the HR recruiting landscape and how companies view diversity.
        This preliminary phase of our research involved a literature review.
        We selected twelve peer-reviewed or legislative works related to social definitions of diversity,
        computational methods to improve organisational diversity, and legal frameworks that impact hiring and prevent
        discrimination. This review helped us understand the
        importance of equal opportunity in hiring, existing work in the DEI software hiring landscape,
        and social definitions of diversity.

        </p>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
        The most salient takeaways from this stage are: <strong> adverse impact and defining diversity </strong>.
        Employers cannot discriminate in hiring based on protected categories. In practice, HR professionals need to be cognizant of discrimination in hiring patterns. Adverse impact is discrimination of a protected group from employment practices that are seemingly neutral. To prevent adverse impact, companies need to ensure that no groups are unfairly hired relative to others.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
          Additionally, to design systems to improve diversity in recruitment, it is important to have a foundational definition of “diversity.”
          Diversity is a nuanced topic that incorporates countless dimensions of
          human experience.
          While it is debatably reductive, diversity in the workforce needs to be
          simplified for organizations to grasp and implement it. This
          simplification reduces diversity in its holistic nature, while making
          it measurable and attainable.
        </p>
        <h4>Interviews</h4>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
        After conducting a literature review, we began to interview HR recruiters and DEI professionals.
        We interviewed <strong>four HR recruiters. They participated in a 30 minute semi-structured interview</strong> with questions
        designed to assess their needs, motivations, and behaviors when attempting to hire diverse candidates.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
        After we conducted the interviews, we coded the transcripts and created an affinity map to pull out themes
        and findings.
        </p>

          Screenshot of our affinity map.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
        <strong>Our interview findings are:</strong>
        <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px" >recruitment strategies can have unintentional consequences on diversity goals, with systemic and individual biases influencing the process. </li>
        <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">The use of quantitative metrics to evaluate DEI initiatives, such as concrete quotas, can sometimes create challenges. </li>
        <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Companies may have varying stances on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). Additionally, requirements for DEI may vary depending on the role. </li>
        </p>

        <h4>Overall Research Takeaways</h4>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
        <ol>
        <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px" >Equal opportunity is fundamental to hiring.</li>
        <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Identifying and sourcing diverse candidates is difficult for recruiters.</li>
        <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Recruitment and hiring strategies may have unintended consequences in diversity hiring.</li>
        <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px" >Metrics-based quotas may be reductive to the complex nature of diversity.</li>
        <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px" >Diversity in hiring is not homogeneous, and differs from role to role and company to company. Additionally, applicants are also a critical stakeholder in diversity hiring.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h4>Ideation</h4>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
          Once we had better insight into the hiring process and the problems they were facing with regards to DEI, we began our ideation process.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
          We spent time brainstorming and paper-prototyping potential solutions.
          From our research, we knew that <strong>adverse impact compliance, sourcing diverse candidates, and identifying diverse
          candidates</strong> were major issues recruiters face with hiring.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
        During ideation, we came up with several ideas. Some of these include:
        <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px" >DEI Impact Report</li>
        <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Sourcing Diverse Qualified Candidates</li>
        <li style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Design Affordances in HR Software to aid recruiters to identify diverse candidates while reviewing profiles.</li>
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">Throughout this process, we were in constant contact with our project sponsor to ensure that we were compliant with
        the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). For example, if a proposed solution was based on nudging recruiters to review a diverse candidate for a role, that discriminates against
        those that the system does not define as "diverse." This leads to an unfair and illegal system. </p>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
        Our final solution dealt with improving the sourcing process for recruiters. <strong>Why sourcing?</strong> During our research, we identified strict
        legal protections that prevent recruiters from knowing the demographics of a candidate. These protect the rights of each applicant.
        As such, we did not have much flexibility in designing a solution after an applicant applies, as there could be unintentional discrimination.
        By focusing on sourcing candidates, we circumvent this barrier while maintaining equal opportunity for all while still promoting diversity.
        </p>

        <h4>Prototype</h4>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
        Our final solution is a sourcing platform that recommends job boards and diversity organizations based on existing company shortfalls. For example,
        if a recruiter is hiring an engineer, our software would look at the current demographics of engineers in the firm. Based on those shortfalls, the software
        recommends sourcing strategies to fill in those gaps. If a company has a racially diverse engineering team, but very little women, our software would recommend
        sourcing strategies to hire more women.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
        Below is the prototype for our clickable data visualization. It is interactive and works for usability research.
      </p>

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1696793440119' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Demographics Home ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ca&#47;CapstoneDemographicsVisualization2_0&#47;DemographicsHome&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='CapstoneDemographicsVisualization2_0&#47;DemographicsHome' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ca&#47;CapstoneDemographicsVisualization2_0&#47;DemographicsHome&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1696793440119');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='900px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='900px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='1977px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">


        Below is the prototype for where our proposed solution lives. In recruiting software like Workday or Greenhouse, we would embed our data visualization that shows the demographic
        information for that specific role.
        </p>
        <img src="../images/wireframe2.png" width = "450px" height = "auto" class="center">

        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
          While the above example is our final design, we went through several iterations. We created an initial version and
          tested it with the same recruiters we interviewed. Based on this usability study, we made several changes to the information displayed,
          the design of the data visualizations, and the interaction flow.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
          We envision this software to be a plug-in for HR information systems like Workday or Greenhouse. A recruiter would be able to
          use the plug-in and go source candidates based on the information provided.
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
          Our final design is based on our research takeaways. By defining diversity shortfalls in a role-by-role basis, we improve diversity in teams, not just in the overall company. Also, by focusing on sourcing
          candidates, we ensure that no one is unfairly treated during the screening process.
        </p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
        This project was an excellent experience and involved all aspects of the design process from research, to ideation and prototyping.
        A lot of hidden work went into this project that I have left out for the sake of brevity. This included the technical implementation,
        details of the interface design, details of the research process, and the lengthy ideation journey our team had.

        </p>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
          One of the most constricting
         but rewarding dimensions of the project was the legal implications. We wanted to create something that maintains equal opportunity for all
         while still promoting diversity. In practice this is very difficult to do. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is the oversight body that
         helps to protect our rights. Businesses must stay in compliance with the EEOC during hiring. This is how we came to the idea of sourcing diverse applicants.
         This delicate balance between promoting diversity and equal rights for all was incredibly interesting and something that my team had no previous
         experience in.
        </p>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p style="font-weight : lighter;font-size : 20px">
        There is a distinct difference in designing for coursework and the industry. In my experience, there are more restrictions
        in the industry because, as it is in the real world, stakeholder needs become stricter. This project made this distiction more apparent.
        For example, our legal system is something I did not have to design around before this project. I hadn't considered institutional
        forces having much influence over the design of technology. This project was an excellent introduction to designing with
        institutions like the law in mind. Additionally, there is some future work that could be done. Next steps would be to create the software so it
        actually works with HR information systems. This might involve bringing in an engineering team and working with them. Also, additional testing and
        conversations with HR recruiters and DEI professionals would polish the final design. We may have missed some crucial perspectives during our research phase.
        By engaging in conversations continually with our users, we can better fill in the gaps we may have missed. Overall, this project was a lot of fun! We also
        won the <a href="https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/hcde-capstone-2023/all-projects/37-happy-to-be-included?authuser=0">HCDE department Capstone Brave Award</a> for this project!
